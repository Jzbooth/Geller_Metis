# Welcome to Week 3: "Regression and Machine Learning Techniques Continued"

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

We will continue our study of Linear Regression this week and develop our understanding of how we 
can continue to improve our LR models as well as understand LR assumptions. We also learn how we can gain 
insight from traditional statistical testing.

### Technical Focus

We are going to start off the week discussing Regularization and we will continue refining our automobile dataset using Regularization techniques. We will also discuss the Null Hypothesis and how this and other statistical methods relate to regression modeling as well as discuss the linear regression assumptions. We will cap off our probability lectures with a lesson of Bayes. Lastly, we are looking forward to seeing your presentations on Friday!
